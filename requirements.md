# CareerBridge AI - Requirements Document

## 1. The Problem

### Unemployment and Skill Mismatch Crisis in India

India faces a critical unemployment challenge, particularly among youth and underprivileged communities. Despite having one of the world's largest working-age populations, millions remain unemployed or underemployed due to:

- **Skill-Job Mismatch**: Educational qualifications don't align with market demands, leaving graduates unemployed while industries face talent shortages
- **Lack of Career Guidance**: Limited access to professional career counseling, especially in rural and semi-urban areas
- **Information Asymmetry**: Unawareness of available government skill development schemes, free training programs, and suitable career pathways
- **Entry Barriers**: Traditional job application processes require resumes, portfolios, and prior experience that many first-time job seekers lack
- **Budget Constraints**: Quality upskilling courses are expensive and inaccessible to economically disadvantaged youth

- **Personalized AI-driven career guidance** tailored to individual skills, interests, and constraints
